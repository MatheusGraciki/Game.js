            <p>1.Certainly! Here's the English version:
                My journey into programming began with a simple desire: 
                hack small games to gain an edge. 
                However, as I delved deeper into this world, something incredible happened.
                I discovered that the real magic lay in creating the tools for it instead of cheating in games. 
                That's when my passion for programming blossomed, and what was once a curious hobby turned into 
                a passionate pursuit of mastering this art. 
                Today, I'm on the hunt for my first job to further enhance my skills and work in what I truly love(As difficult and stressful as this may be)
